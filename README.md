# Summary

This Cognitive Learning App aims to use simple drag-n-drop, as well as on-click triggered games, to help parents, educators, researchers, and developers understand how non-verbal individuals engage, learn and grow.

Although this is a Minimal Viable Product, and not a full functioning app, our aim is to find new ways in how we can assist their journey by improving their comprehensive,  thinking, and social skills that are free from any racial, ability, social-economical, regional, and identity status.

Activities are based on interviews with educators who specialize in teaching children with special needs, parents, and therapists, as well as the Snijders-Oomen Nonverbal Intelligence Test, also known as the SON-R 2 1/2-7 from the Netherlands, and from the US, commonly used methods such as P.E.R.M.A (Positive Emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, and Accomplishments), and research from the Child Mind Institute of NYC.

## Motivation for project

The amount of free apps available that cater to special needs people are very limited, especially those targeted for children of low-income backgrounds.

  This section explains what features are included in this app, this is not a complete app, and focuses on the activities we were able to complete.

### Package Managers

Npm/Yarn

    - In the project folder called "CogLearnOpen", this is the server section:

        npm install or yarn install

    - Then go inside the project folder, and locate the "client" directory:

        cd Cognitive-Learning-App
